Exercise 2:

exploit-2a.py exploits bug #2 (http.c:159) by passing in a header field
with a very long value (a bit over 512). It's not precise, but it
certainly works.

exploit-2b.py exploits bug #5 (http.c:255) by passing in a request path
that's a little longer than 1024. Using gdb, I've even lined it up so
that the last four bytes (the Z's) exactly overwrite the four bytes of
the handler. Thanks to the wonky split_path function, we pass the check
with stat(pn, &st), and the handler is called with the pointer modified
to our value.
